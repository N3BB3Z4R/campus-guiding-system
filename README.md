Campus Guiding System is a Google Maps-like application to provide directions within the HKUST campus.

It calculates the shortest route between any two points in the university, using the Dijkstra's search algorithm.

The system features a rich UI rendered in jQuery UI and jsDraw2D, providing map manipulation and location search functionalities.

The backend is developed in PHP, utilizing MySQL as the database.
